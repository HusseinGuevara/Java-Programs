# Silicon Valley Flight Reservation System Mock App 
Silicon Valley Flight Reservation System is an app that I desinged using Java and Spring Tools 4. I created a series of models and stored them in a MySQL datasbase. I also used some Bootstrap to give a cleaner looking user interface. 

## Features
* One has to register/login and meet validations in order to access site
* Able to book one flight per user
* User most enter credit card information with validations in order to buy flight
* One can change the flight that they wish to purchase
